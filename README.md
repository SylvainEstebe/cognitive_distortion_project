# 🪐 NLP Project: Cognitive Distortion

The first part of the project is to look at the literature about how cognitive distortions/negative thoughts are detected and how generative models could provide good feedback for the user.

The second part is to examine whether, without using the taxonomy created by Beck, we can find clusters in the different thoughts which could indicate another taxonomy.
