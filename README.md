## Description of the data
To demonstrate the functionality of the package as collection of lyrics from danish songs from 10 artists were scraped from Genius.com. Up to 5 songs from each artist were scraped, but only the danish songs were saved. 

| thought | original_label |
| ----------------- | -: |
| Someone I trusted stole something valuable of mine, I was extremely angry and wanted justice       | emotional reasoning |
| She doesn't respect me.        | overgeneralizing |
| **Total**         | **921**|
