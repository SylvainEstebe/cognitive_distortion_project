# 🪐 NLP Project: Data-Driven taxonomy for cognitive distortion

This repository holds the code for the project for Natural Language Processing (S2023). It contains the script of the analysis.

### ⏭ Workflows

## Description of the dataset

| thought | original_label |
| ----------------- | -: |
| Someone I trusted stole something valuable of mine, I was extremely angry and wanted justice       | emotional reasoning |
| She doesn't respect me.        | overgeneralizing |
| **Total**         | **921**|

## Usage and reproducibility

The code was developed and tested on a MacBook Pro with macOS (Sonoma 14.1.2, python v3.9.6).

To reproduce the results , follow the steps below. All terminal commands should be run from the root directory of the repository.


1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install requirements
```
bash setup.sh
```
Think about replacing the different path with your own repertoire, which contains "reframing_dataset.csv" and "thinking_traps.jsonl" 
3. Run the `preprocessing.ipybn` script to: 
    - merge the two dataset
    - some preprocessing
4. Run the `analysis.ipybn` script to: 
    - Do the embedding with sentence-transformer
    - reduction of dimension with UMAP
    - Clustering with k-mean and hdbscan
    - export of results
4. Run the `plot.ipybn` script to:
       - plot the different clusters
5. Run the `label.ipybn` script to:
       - generate label
6. Run the `dashboard.ipybn` script to:
       - generate dashboard
